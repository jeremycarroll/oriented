This is very preliminary.

Target environment is Java 1.6.0 (I am using update 21 for now).

The key goals concern implementing the oriented matroid realizability
algorithm in rank 3 which is discussed in my paper:
http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0704/0704.3424v2.pdf
Particularly we assume the correctness of conjectures 16.15 and 16.16 
and see how far we can go with this assumption.

Much of the work is based on the goal of implementing "the book".
