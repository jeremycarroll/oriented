<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
This open source library allows for the creation and manipulation of oriented matroids
with high quality code; extensive support for pseudolines, and pseudolines diagrams
is provided.
</p>
<p>
It principally covers the cryptomorphic representations
of oriented matroids, allowing seamless conversion between them.
</p>
<p>
Please <a href="mailto:jjc1729@gmail.com">contact me</a>
if you are using this library. 
</p>

<h2>Pseudoline Diagrams</h2>

<p>
The code comes with several <a href="javadoc/net/sf/oriented/omi/Examples.html">examples</a> built-in.
We include pseudoline diagrams of most of them here.
</p>
<p>
A good place to start is <a href="detail/chapter1-6.html">this one</a>, the first example from the TODO Oriented Matroid book.
That page explains how to read the diagrams, in particular, to understand what 'oriented' means in terms
of these diagrams, and the meaning of the origin in this pictures. 
Each picture is a projection of a pseudoline arrangement in the projective plane onto the Euclidean plane,
with the line at infinity turned into an oval around the picture. 
If you are interested, there are a further, somewhat boring, <a href="chapter1.html">five projections</a> of the chapter 1 arrangement.
</p>
<p>
The other examples are more interesting, and are as follows:

<h2>Developer Documentation</h2>
<p>The <a href="javadoc/index.html">on-line javadoc</a> is the guide to the API</p>

<h2>Sourceforge Links</h2>

<h2>Difficulties in Being Straight</h2>
<p>The primary goal is to help me on my long-term project concerning pseudoline stretching.</p>
<p>The fundamental approach is essentially the same as in 
<a href="https://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2000/HPL-2000-72.html">my technical report from 2000</a>,
significantly updated with an oriented matroid viewpoint, 
as described in too much length in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.3424">A New Proof of Pappus's Theorem</a>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Convert to polar co-ordinates
</li>
<li>
Find slope constraining sub-arrangements
</li>
<li>
Express the slope constraint of each sub-arrangement
</li>
<li>
Simultaneously solve the slope constrains.
<dl>
<dt>If insoluble:</dt>
<dd>Convert constraints into a final polynomial</dd>
<dt>If soluble:</dt>
<dd>Create linear program for the <em>r</em> co-ordinates</dd>
<dd>solve that program</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
With release 0.2 of July 2013, the prerequisite work on oriented matroids is 
sufficiently complete: the next release will include some of the implementation of this realizability algorithm
(for rank 3 oriented matroids)
