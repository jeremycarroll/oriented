This Oriented Matroid is the introductory example from <q>Oriented Matroids</q> by
Björner, Las Vergnas, Sturmfels, White and Ziegler.
One of the ways in which they describe it, is with the following picture:
</p>

<p>This is essentially the same picture as our 
<a href="chapter1-6.html">sixth projection</a>.
</p>
<p>
They also define it in terms of the positively and negatively oriented bases.
The orientation of a basis depends on the order in which the elements are considered.
In each of our projections, we consider the elements as ordered, first: the element projected
to infinity, and then the other elements in order going along the line at infinity.
This differs from their ordering (which is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Hence, depending on the parity of the
number of swaps of ordering, we may agree or disagree with their definition of the orientation of a particularly
basis.
</p>
<p>
In addition, we show the orientation of a basis which includes the line projected to infinity
simply by the ordering along the line at infinity.
</p>
<p>In Björner et als. presentation of this matroid, in its original orientation,
they have the following posivie bases:
</p>
<p>
123, 125, 126, 136, 145, 146, 156, 245, 246, 256, 345, 346, 356
</p>
<p>And the following negative bases:</p>
<p>
134, 234, 235
