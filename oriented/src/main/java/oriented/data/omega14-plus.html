This oriented matroid is defined with a chirotope being the
3 by 3 determinants of the above matrix except that:
</p>
<center>
&chi;(L,M,N) = +1
</center>
<p>
This oriented matroid is interesting, because like
<a href="suvorov14.html">Suvorov</a>'s one, its realization space is disconnected.
It is also easier to define, using only integers in the matrix.
