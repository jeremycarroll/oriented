<p>
This oriented matroid is defined with a chirotope being the
3 by 3 determinants of the above matrix except that:
</p>
<center>
&chi;(L,M,N) = &minus;1
</center>
<p>
This oriented matroid is interesting, because, like <a href="ringel.html">Ringel</a>'s it is not
realizable, but in addition, the method of proving its non-realizability by
finding a biquadratic final polynomial does not work.
