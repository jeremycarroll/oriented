Line 2 in the picture above does not directly border onto the positive face
(it does touch the face at a point).
Our convention of always placing the origin in a face bordering the line at infinity (i.e. an unbounded face)
leaves us with a problem when we wish to project line 2 to infinity. We resolve that problem
by reorienting the matroid by flipping the orientation of pseudoline 1. With this change,
as below, we can label a face with the origin since it is the positive face in the reoriented matroid,
and it does border line 2. Any basis which includes line 1 is flipped from positively oriented to negatively
oriented (or conversely).
