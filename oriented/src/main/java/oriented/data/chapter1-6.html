The positive bases involving element 6 are all represented
by the ordering along the line.
Some of the other bases have their orientation changed, because we have swapped the order of 2 and 3, and 4 and 5.

<p>
The picture below is very similar to their picture above, rotated through 180&deg;. They show the positive
face (labeled 123456) in the top right, whereas we show the positive face in the bottom left, labeled with an arrow.
Their other labels can be reconstructed in our diagram by remembering that the arrow is in the positive face, 
and that every time we cross a pseudoline in the arrangement the sign of that element changes. Also, any point or edge
on a pseudoline is unsigned for that element.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, our diagram shows the positively and negatively oriented bases as follows.
For any three elements, not including the element at infinity:
</p>
<ul>
<li>If the pseudolines are coincident then the elements do not form a basis.</li>
<li>If the  first and last elements (in the order at infinity) intersect on the opposite  side
of the middle element  to the origin, then they form a positive basis</li>
<li>If the  first and last elements (in the order at infinity) intersect on the same side
of the middle element as the origin, then they form a negative basis</li>
</ul>
<p>
Notice that this simple visiual indication of positive and negative bases requires the origin
to be in a face with one of its edges being the line at infinity. In some cases,
such as <a href="chapter1-2.html">this other projection</a>, this requires
that the oriented matroid is reoriented before being represented as pseudolines.
