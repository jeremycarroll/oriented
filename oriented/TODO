Overall goal 
============
- support realizability and non-realizability proofs for rank 3.

Follow approach of "New Proof of Pappus (2007)", and "Drawing Straight Lines (2000)"

Sketch of algorithm:
- take chirotope
- choose an infinity/zero
- order the other lines
- prune the chirotope at non-zero lines
- convert to polar coordinate matrix
- extract edges of twisted graph
- find minimal twisted graphs
- solve each minimal twisted graph
- make solution simultaneous
- solve linear program

Project includes writing papers that prove this algorithm works.


0.2 release goals
=================

Main goal for 0.2:
- take chirotope
- choose an infinity/zero
- order the other lines
