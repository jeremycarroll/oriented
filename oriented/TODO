Overall goal - support realizability and non-realizability proofs for rank 3.

Follow approach of "New Proof of Pappus (2007)", and "Drawing Straight Lines (2000)"

Sketch of algorithm:
- take chirotope
- choose an infinity/zero
- order the other lines
- prune the chirotope at non-zero lines
- convert to polar coordinate matrix
- extract edges of twisted graph
- find minimal twisted graphs
- solve each minimal twisted graph
- make solution simultaneous
- solve linear program


SubGoal June 28, 2013
- new feature: given OM, give all possible 'positive' chirotopes, through reorderings
  and reorientations.
  Positive chirotope is one in which the first load of signs are non-negative
  Where first depends on the rank, for rank 3 it is triangle(n-2)
  
- add support for permutations
- check factories really do remake correctly: some doubt around the chirotope factory
   - add tests that exercise Factory.remake() and equality etc
   
   
SubGoal June 28, 2013
- add some more examples, add tests for their level of symmetry by looking at
  the number of reorientations
- include non-pappus
- include omega14 +,-,0
- include chap1
- include general circular saw construct
- include Ceva

SubGoal June 28, 2013
- example generating code that is robust against 0 as opposed to +/-

SubGoal June 28
- sort out Pair in OMChirotopeFactory

SubGoal July 1
- change generic type declarations to use long words not letters
